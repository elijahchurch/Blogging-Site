                <img class="fav suv" src="images/Yam_Yam.jpeg" alt="Picture of Yam Yam">
                <h4>Pros</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Has made connections and friendships with most of the other players, guarenteeing at least some votes if he makes it to Final 3.</li>
                        <li> Has had a very strong social game, being able to play many sides and sniff out lies.</li>
                        <li> Voted out all threats that tried to eliminate him in the inital days of the Merge.</li>
                        <li> Part of the strong, on-going Tika 3 alliance, with Carolyn and Carson.</li>
                        <li> Won 1 individual immunity challenge</li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>Cons</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Even with 1 immunity win, hasn't been the strongest competitor for most of the season.</li>
                        <li> Will need to differentiate his strategic game from the other Tika members, especially Carson who many perceive to be the strategic leader of the alliance.</li>
                    </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="people">
                <h3 class="final5"> Carson </h3>
                <img  class="suv" src="images/Carson.jpeg" alt="Picture of Carson">
                <h4>Pros</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Has had the strongest strategic game of the final contestants.</li>
                        <li> Won 1 individual immunity challenge.</li>
                        <li> Most likely to win 1 or more challenges in the finale, being a well-rounded physical player and someone who excels at puzzle portions of challenges.</li>
                        <li> Also has many positive social connections with the other players.</li>
                        <li> Part of the strong, on-going Tika 3 alliance, with Carolyn and Yam Yam.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>Cons</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Will need to differentiate his game from the other Tika members, who both have more vibrant personalities that may sway votes.</li>
                        <li> Has a large target on his back, as he is perceived as the strategic leader of the Tika 3.</li>
                    </ul>
                
            </div>

                        <li> Part of the strong, on-going Tika 3 alliance, with Yam Yam and Carson.</li>
                        <li> Of the Tika 3, Carolyn is perceived as the lowest threat, which would shield her from elimination at the tribal council of 5.</li>
                        <li> Was able to keep a hidden immunity idol secret for the entire game.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>Her strong personality has also caused her to have some conflicts with other contestants. </li>
                        <li>The weakest competitor of the final contestants and has no individual immunity challenge wins.</li>
