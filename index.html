                <h4>Pros</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Has made connections and friendships with most of the other players, guarenteeing at least some votes if he makes it to Final 3.</li>
                        <li> Has had a very strong social game, being able to play many sides and sniff out lies.</li>
                        <li> Voted out all threats that tried to eliminate him in the inital days of the Merge.</li>
                        <li> Part of the strong, on-going Tika 3 alliance, with Carolyn and Carson.</li>

                        <li> Even with 1 immunity win, hasn't been the strongest competitor for most of the season.</li>
                        <li> Will need to differentiate his strategic game from the other Tika members, especially Carson who many perceive to be the strategic leader of the alliance.</li>
                    </ul>
            </div>

                        <li> Also has many positive social connections with the other players.</li>
                        <li> Part of the strong, on-going Tika 3 alliance, with Carolyn and Yam Yam.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>Cons</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Will need to differentiate his game from the other Tika members, who both have more vibrant personalities that may sway votes.</li>
                        <li> Has a large target on his back, as he is perceived as the strategic leader of the Tika 3.</li>

                        <li> Part of the strong, on-going Tika 3 alliance, with Yam Yam and Carson.</li>
                        <li> Of the Tika 3, Carolyn is perceived as the lowest threat, which would shield her from elimination at the tribal council of 5.</li>
                        <li> Was able to keep a hidden immunity idol secret for the entire game.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li> The Tika 3 view her as more of a threat than Heidi, making her most likey to get voted out at the tribal council of 5 if she does not win immunity.</li>
                    </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="people">
                <h3 class="final5">Heidi</h3>
