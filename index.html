                <h4>Pros</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Has made connections and friendships with most of the other players, guarenteeing at least some votes if he makes it to Final 3.</li>
                        <li> Has had a very strong social game, being able to play many sides and sniff out lies.</li>
                        <li> Voted out all threats that tried to eliminate him in the inital days of the Merge.</li>
                        <li> Part of the strong, on-going Tika 3 alliance, with Carolyn and Carson.</li>
                        <li> Won 1 individual immunity challenge</li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>Cons</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Even with 1 immunity win, hasn't been the strongest competitor for most of the season.</li>
                        <li> Will need to differentiate his strategic game from the other Tika members, especially Carson who many perceive to be the strategic leader of the alliance.</li>
                    </ul>
